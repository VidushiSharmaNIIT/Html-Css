<p> Just a few days into its release in American cinemas, Spectre—James Bond’s latest big-screen outing—is already poised to take a $75 million chunk out of the weekend box office. While it’s still got more than $1 billion to go to catch up to 2012’s Skyfall, the most profitable Bond film thus far, that entry alone was enough to make the James Bond series one of Hollywood’s most successful franchises of all time. Though 007 has both longevity (he’s been starring in movies for more than a half-century) and prolificacy (Spectre marks his 24th film), neither proved enough to nab him the top spot in the 10 highest grossing movie franchises of all time, based on worldwide box office.</p>

   These are types of films known to promote intense excitement, suspense, a high level of anticipation, ultra-heightened expectation, uncertainty, anxiety, and nerve-wracking tension. Thriller and suspense films are virtually synonymous and interchangeable categorizations, with similar characteristics and features. If the genre is to be defined strictly, a genuine thriller is a film that rentlessly pursues a single-minded goal - to provide thrills and keep the audience cliff-hanging at the 'edge of their seats' as the plot builds towards a climax. The tension usually arises when the main character(s) is placed in a menacing situation or mystery, or an escape or dangerous mission from which escape seems impossible. Life itself is threatened, usually because the principal character is unsuspecting or unknowingly involved in a dangerous or potentially deadly situation. Plots of thrillers involve characters which come into conflict with each other or with outside forces - the menace is sometimes abstract or shadowy.Thrillers are often hybrids - there are lots of varieties of suspense-thrillers:

    action- or adventure- thrillers
    sci-fi thrillers (such as Alien (1979))
    crime-caper thrillers (such as The French Connection (1971))
    western-thrillers (such as High Noon (1952))
    film-noir thrillers (such as Double Indemnity (1944))
    even romantic comedy-thrillers (such as Safety Last (1923))
